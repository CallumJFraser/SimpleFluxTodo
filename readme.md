Simple Flux Todo
===

This Todo application is my attempt at a simple client side flux implementation mostly as a learning experiance.

I felt the example on the flux website is unnessasarally overcomplicated for someone to run thorugh and understand.

Setup
====

run `npm i` in command line/terminal to install node dependencies.

Run
====

run `npm run build` to build the src/index.jsx file into the needed dist/index.js file.

run `npm run build-listen` to start build listener.

run `npm run dev` to run the webpack package listener for local hosting.

You can run the last 2 commands in 2 seperate terminals to automatically update any changes.
